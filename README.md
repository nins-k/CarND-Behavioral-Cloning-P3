# Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree

## Term 1 : Project 03 - **Behavioral Cloning**

---

My project includes the following files:
* [model.py](./model.py) - script to create and train the model.
* [drive.py](./drive.py) - for driving the car in autonomous mode.
* [model.h5](./model.h5) - containing a trained convolution neural network 
* [writeup_report.md](./writeup_report.md) - This file is the Write Up report/summary.
* [P3_Model_Generator.ipynb](./P3_Model_Generator.ipynb) - Additionally, I have included the IPython Notebook I used to write the code.
